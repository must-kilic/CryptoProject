# CryptoProject
This project demonstrates basic client–server communication using a React frontend and an ASP.NET Core backend.  Currently includes a simple echo endpoint where messages sent from the frontend are returned by the backend.  Future updates will add encryption algorithms like Caesar, Vigenere, Hill, AES, and RSA.
